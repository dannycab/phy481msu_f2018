How many boundary conditions (on the potential $V$) do you use to find $V$ inside the spherical plastic shell?

<img src="./images/plastic_shell_vtheta.png" align="right" style="width: 350px";/>


1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
5. It depends on $V_0(\theta)$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Good for discussion; obviously you need the surface BC, but what about at r=0? Is that technically a BC?

1. $+q\mathbf{d}$
2. $-q\mathbf{d}$
3. Zero
4. None of these
