How many boundary conditions (on the potential $V$) do you use to find $V$ inside the spherical plastic shell?

<img src="./images/plastic_shell_vtheta.png" align="right" style="width: 350px";/>


1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
5. It depends on $V_0(\theta)$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Good for discussion; obviously you need the surface BC, but what about at r=0? Is that technically a BC?

Two charges are positioned as shown to the left. The relative position vector between them is $\mathbf{d}$. What is the value of of the dipole moment? $\sum_i q_i \mathbf{r}_i$

1. $+q\mathbf{d}$
2. $-q\mathbf{d}$
3. Zero
4. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

Multipole Expansion of the Power Spectrum of CMBR

Note: The radiation from cosmic microwave background can be described in terms of contributions using a basis of functions with increasing smaller contributions.

For a dipole at the origin pointing in the z-direction, we have derived:

$$\mathbf{E}_{dip}(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{p}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3}\left(2 \cos \theta\;\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin \theta\;\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)$$

<img src="./images/small_dipole.png" align="right" style="width: 200px";/>


For the dipole $\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{d}$ shown, what does the formula predict for the direction of $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}=0)$?

1. Down
2. Up
3. Some other direction
4. The formula doesn't apply

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* The formula works far from the dipole only.
