The torque on a magnetic dipole in a B field is:

$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$

How will a small current loop line up if the B field points uniformly up the page?

A solid cylinder has uniform magnetization $\mathbf{M}$ throughout the volume in the $\phi$ direction as shown. In which direction does the bound surface current flow on the (curved) sides?

1. There is no bound surface current.
2. The current flows in the $\pm \phi$ direction.
3. The current flows in the $\pm s$ direction.
4. The current flows in the $\pm z$ direction.
5. The direction is more complicated.
