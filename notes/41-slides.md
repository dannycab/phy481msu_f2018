A very long aluminum (paramagnetic!) rod carries a uniformly distributed current $I$ along the $+z$ direction.
What is the direction of the bound volume current?

1. $\mathbf{J}_B$ points parallel to $I$
2. $\mathbf{J}_B$ points anti-parallel to $I$
3. It’s zero!
4. Other/not sure

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

A very long aluminum (paramagnetic!) rod carries a uniformly distributed current $I$ along the $+z$ direction. We know $\mathbf{B}$ will be CCW as viewed from above. (Right?) What about $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ inside the cylinder?

<img src="./images/Al_rod_example_B_shown.png" align="right" style="width: 200px";/>


1. Both are CCW
2. Both are CW
3. $\mathbf{H}$ is CCW, but $\mathbf{M}$ is CW
4. $\mathbf{H}$ is CW, $\mathbf{M}$ is CCW
5. ???

For linearly magnetizable materials, the relationship between the magnetization and the H-field is,

$\mathbf{M} = \chi_m \mathbf{H}$

What do you expect the sign of $X_m$ to be for a paramagnetic/diamagnetic material?

1. para: $\chi_m<0 \;$ dia: $\chi_m>0$
2. para: $\chi_m>0 \;$ dia: $\chi_m<0$
3. Both positive
4. Both negative

Note:
Correct answer: B
