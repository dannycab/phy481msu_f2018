Two charges are positioned as shown to the left. The relative position vector between them is $\mathbf{d}$. What is the dipole moment of this configuration?

$$\sum_i q_i \mathbf{r}_i$$

1. $+q\mathbf{d}$
2. $-q\mathbf{d}$
3. Zero
4. None of these; it's more complicated than before!

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

For a dipole at the origin pointing in the z-direction, we have derived:

$$\mathbf{E}_{dip}(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{p}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3}\left(2 \cos \theta\;\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin \theta\;\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)$$

For the dipole $\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{d}$ shown, what does the formula predict for the direction of $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}=0)$?

1. Down
2. Up
3. Some other direction
4. The formula doesn't apply

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* The formula works far from the dipole only.
