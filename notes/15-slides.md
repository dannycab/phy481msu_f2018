With $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0$, we know that,

$$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$$

If we choose a loop that includes a metal and vacuum (i.e., both in and just outside of the metal), we know that the contribution to this integral in the metal vanishes. What can we say about the contribution just outside the metal?

1. It vanishes also
2. $\mathbf{E}$ must be zero out there
3. $\mathbf{E}$ must be perpendicular to d$\mathbf{l}$ everywhere
4. $\mathbf{E}$ is perpendicular to the metail surface
5. More than one of these

Note:
* Correct answer: E (both A and D)

1. Zero
2. $-q$
3. $+q$
4. $0 < q_{outer} < +q$
5. $-q < q_{outer} < 0$

and the outside of the outer conductor?

1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

You have two very large parallel plate capacitors, both with the same area and the same charge $Q$.
Capacitor \#1 has twice the gap of Capacitor \#2. Which has more stored potential energy?

1. \#1 has twice the stored energy
2. \#1 has more than twice
3. They both have the same
4. \#2 has twice the stored energy
5. \#2 has more than twice.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* E same; twice volume
