What do you expect to happen to the field as you get really far from the rod?

$$E_x = \dfrac{\lambda}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\}\dfrac{L}{x\sqrt{x^2+L^2}}$$

1. $E_x$ goes to 0.
2. $E_x$ begins to look like a point charge.
3. $E_x$ goes to $\infty$.
4. More than one of these is true.
5. I can't tell what should happen to $E_x$.

Note:
CORRECT ANSWER: D (A and B)
