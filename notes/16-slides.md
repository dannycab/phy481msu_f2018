A parallel plate capacitor is attached to a battery which maintains a constant voltage difference V between the capacitor plates.  While the battery is attached, the plates are pulled apart. The electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor

1. increases.
2. decreases.
3. stays constant.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Potential same; field is reduced; but shows up squared while d is increased, overall goes down

A region of space contains no charges. What can I say about $V$ in the interior?

1. Not much, there are lots of possibilities for $V(r)$ in there
2. $V(r)=0$ everywhere in the interior.
3. $V(r)=$constant everywhere in the interior

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
