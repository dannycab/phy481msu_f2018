A point charge $+q$ is placed at the center of a neutral, linear, homogeneous, dielectric teflon shell. Can $\mathbf{D}$ be computed from its divergence?

<img src="./images/teflon_shell_D.png" align="left" style="width: 300px";/>

$$\oint \mathbf{D} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = Q_{free}$$

1. Yes
2. No
3. Depends on other things not given

A point charge $+q$ is placed at the center of a neutral, linear, homogeneous, dielectric **hemispherical** shell. Can $\mathbf{D}$ be computed from its divergence?

## Why are these boundary conditions useful?

In the boundary condition for $E_{\perp}$, the difference across the boundary is $\dfrac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}.$ What does that $\sigma$ contain?

1. Just $\sigma_{f}$
2. Just $\sigma_{b}$
3. Both
4. Something else

Note: Correct answer C

Let's assume the normal vector at the material boundary points upward.

<img src="./images/cap_w_2_dielectrics.png" align="center" style="width: 300px";/>

What the sign of the dot product of the electric field and this normal vector above and below the boundary (i.e., $\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{n}$)?

1. Above is positive; below is negative
2. Above is negative; below is negative
3. Above is negative; below is positive
4. Above is positive; below is positive


Note: Correct answer B
