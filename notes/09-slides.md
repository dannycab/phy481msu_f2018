1. q
2. 2 q
3. 4 q
4. 6 q
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D (write it out)
* Follow up what does it look like?

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $â€“q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though?
