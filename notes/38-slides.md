What is the physical interpretation of $\oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$?

1. The current density $\mathbf{J}$
2. The magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$
3. The magnetic flux $\Phi_B$
4. It's none of the above, but is something simple and concrete
5. It has no particular physical interpretation at all

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

<section data-markdown>
The leading term in the vector potential multipole expansion involves:

$\oint d\mathbf{l}'$

What is the magnitude of this integral?


1. $R$
2. $2\pi R$
3. 0
4. Something entirely different/it depends!

Note:

Two magnetic dipoles $m_1$ and $m_2$ (equal in magnitude) are oriented in three different ways.

Which ones can produce a dipole field at large distances?

1. None of these
2. All three
3. 1 only
4. 1 and 2 only
5. 1 and 3 only

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
